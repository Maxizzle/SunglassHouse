#SunglassHouse

The idea behind the site is just your typical e-commerce platform.
I went with sunglasses cause I think theyâ€™re one of the most important accessories 
you can carry because one, you carry them on your face so it is the first thing people 
see when they come in contact with you so it matters how they look and more importantly how
they look on you.
Second , they help with visibility on bright and sunny days while also protecting your eyes from
harmful UV rays eminating from our personal star.

It was a bit of struggle being that was my first project, trying to combine what we've accumulated
in just two weeks to put together a picture that not only is appealing but aslo functioning.
Nonetheless is was fun and i really enjoyed doing it.
